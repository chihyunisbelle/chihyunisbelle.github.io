										It's Belle here</a></h2> -->
									<p>a software engineer with a decade of experience in architectural design and construction management,
                                        blending curiosity for technology and passion for design to build meaningful software solution</p>

									<p>With a background in architecture and construction, I bring a unique perspective to software engineering. My experience in managing complex projects and collaborating with diverse teams has equipped me to approach development with a focus on both technical and user-centric solutions. After completing an intensive full-stack program, I’ve honed skills in database management, programming, and UI design. I’m passionate about writing clean, effective code and building intuitive interfaces that connect seamlessly with users. I’m excited to bring my blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving to a dynamic engineering team. Colleagues often seek my input for a second opinion, as I enjoy sharing knowledge and exploring diverse perspectives to tackle challenges.
                                        <br />With 20 years of experience living and working across various countries and cultures, I excel at quickly adapting to new environments and collaborating effectively in diverse teams. This adaptability has served me well in projects ranging from the Sussex Vibe Hotel with Sutro Architects to collaborations with Pierre Studio. Each experience has reinforced my ability to learn new software quickly and adapt to project-specific requirements.
                                        <br />My expertise in 3D modeling and BIM software (Autodesk Revit) has inspired me to explore creative work in virtual reality and gaming environments, fueling my passion for coding. I believe that my architectural background has shaped me into a persistent problem-solver who sees the big picture while attending to the smallest details. The thrill of writing code and seeing it achieve its intended purpose drives my passion for software engineering.
                                        <br />As I transition into this new chapter of my career, I'm excited to bring my unique blend of skills to a dynamic software engineering team. I'm confident that my adaptability, creative problem-solving, and user-centric approach will contribute to building innovative and impactful software solutions.
